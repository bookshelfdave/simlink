# simlink

Does `ln -s` bring the phrase [\<lotion brand\>, take me away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNgZFxAnKtA) to mind?

If so, then try simlink! Simlink doesn't care which order you specify arguments! All you need is a file/directory that exists, and one that doesn't (yet!). Isn't this so very exciting!
