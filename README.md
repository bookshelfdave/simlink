# simlink

Do you remember the order of args to make a symlink? I unually don't! 

Simlink doesn't care which order you specify arguments! All you need is a file/directory that exists, and one that doesn't (yet!). This is going to [change the world](http://www.zombo.com/)!!

	
### Building

You'll need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.6.0.

	cargo build
	./target/debug/simlink some_path some_other_path
	
### Are you serious?
